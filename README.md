## User Story
    `
    AS A manager at an internet retail company
    I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
    SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
    `

## Installation
  The files may be accessed individually via my GitHub repository located at: (https://github.com/kheeb/e-commerceArchitecture). 
  
  Alternatively, clone the repository to your local machine, create a .env file with the database name along with your MySQL password and username, and run `npm i` to install dependencies.
  
  Within the integrated terminal, run `mysql -u root -p` then source the schema by running `source db/schema.sql`, then `quit` to exit the shell. Then seed the files by running `npm run seed && npm run start` and access the database from there once the port is listening.
